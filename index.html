I'm currently a product manager at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>, where
I work on cloud data warehousing.
</p>

<p>
Before IBM, I completed my BA and MA in Computer Science at 
<a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/">Wesleyan University</a>, where I did
research in programming languages and was advised by 
<a href="http://dlicata.web.wesleyan.edu">Dan Licata</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research at Wesleyan focused on mechanized verification and semi-automated
complexity analysis.  I developed a system in <a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a>, 
a dependently typed language and proof assistant, to extract and formally reason
about recurrence relations from functional programs.  I've also worked on a wide
range of projects outside of this, from theorem provers to data visualization.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy working on challenging, complex problems, which take me way out of my
comfort zone. I also enjoy discussing them with others, and taking the time to
learn new things whenever I'm not at work - lately I've dug into applied
cryptography (hacking my way through the Matasano crypto challenges) and tech
agriculture.  You may have seen me at <a href="http://2017.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G 2017</a>, <a href="https://deepspec.org/event/dsss17/index.html">DSSS 2017</a>, 
and <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer16/">OPLSS 2016</a>.
