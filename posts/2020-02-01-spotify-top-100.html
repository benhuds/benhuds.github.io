<p>Spotify always does a great job with their end-of-year summaries and “Your Top Songs of 20__&quot; playlists – I love seeing how my taste in music has changed over time. At the end of 2019, Spotify presented a summary with my most frequent songs and artists for the decade overall, and I was hoping they’d wrap this up nicely into something like a “Your Top Songs” playlist as they’ve done for each individual year. I was excited to see they did indeed publish a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/spotify-wrapped-how-to-see-your-top-songs-for-2019-and-the-decade/">“Best of the Decade For You” playlist</a>. Unfortunately, I quickly found that it listed songs I definitely did not recognize.</p>
<p>As an alternative, I looked into ways to create a real “Best of the Decade” myself using the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify Web API</a>. The playlist would contain the 100 most-played songs over the course of my Spotify membership. While I did find <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/personalization/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks">some</a> <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/playlists/add-tracks-to-playlist/">useful</a> <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/playlists/create-playlist/">documentation</a>, I found two limitations that prevented me from creating the playlist I wanted:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Spotify’s “Top Artists/Tracks” functionality doesn’t allow you to get your top artists/tracks based on play count. Instead, they use something named <em>affinity</em>, which Spotify describes is “<em>a measure of the expected preference a user has for a particular track or artist. It is based on user behavior, including play history, but does not include actions made while in incognito mode.</em>”</p></li>
<li>Spotify’s “Top Artists/Tracks” functionality allows you to get your top artists/tracks based on affinity over a certain time frame by adding an optional parameter <code>time_range</code>. There are three possible values:
<ul>
<li><code>long_term</code> (Spotify: “<em>calculated from several years of data and including all new data as it becomes available</em>”)</li>
<li><code>medium_term</code> (Spotify: “<em>approximately last 6 months</em>”)</li>
<li><code>short_term</code> (Spotify: “<em>approximately last 4 weeks</em>”)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of my playlist, the only viable option was to set <code>time_range=long_term</code>, but the resulting playlist didn’t look like it included songs from my early days of Spotify (2011/2012-ish). Oh well.</p>
<p>Despite these two limitations, I ended up with a pretty good playlist and learned a bit about Spotify’s Web API. Check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/benhuds/spotify-top-songs">GitHub</a>.</p>
