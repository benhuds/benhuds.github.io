    I recently attended a dinner where Polish grandmothers cooked <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go%C5%82%C4%85bki">gołąbki</a></em> (roughly pronounced "gwolm-ki," from what I recall), a traditional Polish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage_roll">cabbage roll</a> dish. The food was great, but reading about the theories behind the dish's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go%C5%82%C4%85bki#Etymology">etymology</a> sent me into a bit of a rabbit hole:
</p>

<blockquote>
    
<p>
    <em>
        "[While] Gołąbki is the plural form of gołąbek, the diminutive form of gołąb ("pigeon, dove"), [the Polish linguist Marek Stachowski] proposes an Oriental borrowing, pointing out that a similar dish, aside from Eastern Europe, is known in the Levant and Central Asia. <b>He mentions Persian کلم kalam "cabbage" or کلم پیچ‎ kalam pič "cabbage roll" and Old Armenian կաղամբ kałamb "cabbage"</b> as possible sources.""
    </em>
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
    Like Stachowski's proposed etymology for <em>gołąbki</em>, the word for "cabbage" in Thai <em>กะหล่ำปลี ka-lǎm-plii</em> also sounds like the Persian word <em>کلم kalam</em>. I've only (deliberately) come across a handful of Persian loanwords in Thai and have somehow never seen the word for "cabbage" mentioned in any loanword lists<sup>1</sup>, so it was nice to confirm the connection after finding this <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Thai_terms_derived_from_Classical_Persian">page</a> and <a href="https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/southeast-asia-i">article</a> – the latter of which notes:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
    <em>
        "The Thai words for “cabbage,” kalam plii, and “cauliflower,” kalam dork, contain the Persian loanword kalam, “cabbage.” The Persian word for “cauliflower” is gol-e kalam, literally “the flower of the cabbage” which is the exact meaning of the Thai equivalent kalam dork."
    </em>
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
    It's well-established that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language">Thai language</a> is full of loanwords<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>2</sup></span>. It's easy to identify loanwords from languages that had a heavy influence on Thai (e.g., Sanskrit, Pali, Khmer, and Chinese), but it's more fun to trace the history of words that don't have such an obvious connection (probably also because I'm not an expert in Old Persian, either). It's even more fun when food from a completely unrelated culture leads you to stumble into this connection.

<p>
    <span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>1</sup></span> The most famous Persian loanword in Thai is undoubtedly <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farang#Southeast_Asia">ฝรั่ง farang</a></em> – the word for "person of white race." A couple of other familiar Persian loanwords include <em>กุหลาบ gu-lǎab</em> (rose), which comes from گلاب golâb<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>3</sup></span> and <em>องุ่น a-ngǔn</em> (grape), which comes from انگور angur.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>2</sup></span> Thai is heavily influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali">Pali</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Khmer">Old Khmer</a>, and Chinese (particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_dialect">Teochew dialect</a>, which is somewhat related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien">Hokkien</a>), and contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_loanwords_in_Thai">loanwords</a> from several other languages, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language#French-origin">French</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language#Portuguese-origin">Portuguese</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language#Persian-origin">Persian</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>3</sup></span> This word also gives us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulab_jamun">gulab jamun</a>, the popular dessert from the Indian subcontinent.
