# Puzzles and Brain Teasers

## The Josephus Problem

There are $n$ people in a circle, numbered from 1 to $n$.  Every second person
in the circle is executed until one remains.  For example, in a circle of 5
people, Person 5 survives:

```
Person 1 kills Person 2
Person 3 kills Person 4
Person 5 kills Person 1
```

Person 1 survives in a circle of 8 people:

```
Person 1 kills Person 2
Person 3 kills Person 4
Person 5 kills Person 6
Person 7 kills Person 8
Person 1 kills Person 3
Person 5 kills Person 7
Person 1 kills Person 5
```

Which person survives in a circle of 100 people?  How about a circle of $n$
people?  Read more about this problem

## Horse racing

You need to find the 3 fastest horses in a herd of 25 horses.  You have a
racetrack with 5 lanes, so you can race 5 horses at a time.  Unfortunately, you
don't have a stopwatch.  What is the smallest number of races needed to find the
3 fastest horses?  Assume (unrealistically) every horse runs at the same speed
for each race.

## Rope around the Earth

Imagine a rope that is tied around the diameter of the Earth, taut against the
Earth's surface.  How much more rope do you need in order to raise the rope to
be 1 foot above the Earth's surface the whole way around?  Assume
(unrealistically) the Earth is spherical and the rope does not drop into
canyons/go over mountains.
