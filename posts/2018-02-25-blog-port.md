title: From Hugo to Hakyll

Decided to port my personal website from [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) to
[Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). It was a pretty painless process, mostly
thanks to the easy documentation and the fact that I don't need a lot of other
bells or whistles.

```sh
stack install hakyll
hakyll init my-site

cd my-site
stack init
stack build

stack exec site build
stack exec site watch
```

You'll need to rebuild if you make changes to `site.hs`, for example if you need
to add an `assets` folder and its contents (photos, resumes, etc.) to your site:

```haskell
match "assets/*" $ do
    route   idRoute
    compile copyFileCompiler
```
