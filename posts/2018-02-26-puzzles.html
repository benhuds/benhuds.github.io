<h2 id="the-josephus-problem">The Josephus Problem</h2>
<p>There are <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> people in a circle, numbered from 1 to <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>. Every second person in the circle is executed until one remains. For example, in a circle of 5 people, Person 5 survives:</p>
<pre><code>Person 1 kills Person 2
Person 3 kills Person 4
Person 5 kills Person 1</code></pre>
<p>Person 1 survives in a circle of 8 people:</p>
<pre><code>Person 1 kills Person 2
Person 3 kills Person 4
Person 5 kills Person 6
Person 7 kills Person 8
Person 1 kills Person 3
Person 5 kills Person 7
Person 1 kills Person 5</code></pre>
<p>Which person survives in a circle of 100 people? How about a circle of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> people? Read more about this problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="horse-racing">Horse racing</h2>
<p>You need to find the 3 fastest horses in a herd of 25 horses. You have a racetrack with 5 lanes, so you can race 5 horses at a time. Unfortunately, you don’t have a stopwatch. What is the smallest number of races needed to find the 3 fastest horses? Assume (unrealistically) every horse runs at the same speed for each race.</p>
<h2 id="rope-around-the-earth">Rope around the Earth</h2>
<p>Imagine a rope that is tied around the diameter of the Earth, taut against the Earth’s surface. How much more rope do you need in order to raise the rope to be 1 foot above the Earth’s surface the whole way around? Assume (unrealistically) the Earth is spherical and the rope does not drop into canyons/go over mountains.</p>
